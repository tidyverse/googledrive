#' @param path Specifies target destination for the new <%= name %> on Google
#'   Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked with [as_id()],
#'   or a [`dribble`]. If specified as an actual path, it is best to explicitly
#'   indicate if it's a folder by including a trailing slash, since it cannot
#'   always be worked out from the context of the call. <%= default %>
