#' @param path Specifies target destination for the new file on Google Drive.
#'   Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked with
#'   \code{\link{as_id}()}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. If specified as an
#'   actual path, it is best to explicitly indicate if it's a folder by
#'   including a trailing slash, since it cannot always be worked out from the
#'   context of the call.
