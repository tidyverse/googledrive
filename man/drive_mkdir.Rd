\title{Create a Drive folder}
\usage{
drive_mkdir(name, path = NULL, ..., overwrite = NA, verbose = deprecated())
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name for the new folder or, optionally, a path that specifies
an existing parent folder, as well as the new name.}

\item{path}{Target destination for the new folder, i.e. a folder or a
shared drive. Can be given as an actual path (character), a file id or URL
marked with \code{\link[=as_id]{as_id()}}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. Defaults to your "My Drive" root
folder. If \code{path} is a shortcut to a folder, it is automatically resolved
to its target folder.}

\item{...}{Named parameters to pass along to the Drive API. Has \link[rlang:dyn-dots]{dynamic dots} semantics. You can affect the metadata of the target file by
specifying properties of the Files resource via \code{...}. Read the "Request
body" section of the Drive API docs for the associated endpoint to learn
about relevant parameters.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical, indicating whether to check for a pre-existing file
at the targetted "filepath". The quotes around "filepath" refer to the fact
that Drive does not impose a 1-to-1 relationship between filepaths and files,
like a typical file system; read more about that in \code{\link[=drive_get]{drive_get()}}.
\itemize{
\item \code{NA} (default): Just do the operation, even if it results in multiple
files with the same filepath.
\item \code{TRUE}: Check for a pre-existing file at the filepath. If there is
zero or one, move a pre-existing file to the trash, then carry on. Note
that the new file does not inherit any properties from the old one, such
as sharing or publishing settings. It will have a new file ID. An error is
thrown if two or more pre-existing files are found.
\item \code{FALSE}: Error if there is any pre-existing file at the filepath.
}

Note that existence checks, based on filepath, are expensive operations, i.e.
they require additional API calls.}

\item{verbose}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} This logical argument to
individual googledrive functions is deprecated. To globally suppress
googledrive messaging, use \code{options(googledrive_quiet = TRUE)} (the default
behaviour is to emit informational messages). To suppress messaging in a
more limited way, use the helpers \code{\link[=local_drive_quiet]{local_drive_quiet()}} or
\code{\link[=with_drive_quiet]{with_drive_quiet()}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{dribble}}, a tibble with one row per file.
}
\description{
Creates a new Drive folder. To update the metadata of an existing Drive file,
including a folder, use \code{\link[=drive_update]{drive_update()}}.
