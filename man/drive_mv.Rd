\title{Move a Drive file}
\usage{
drive_mv(
  file,
  path = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  overwrite = NA,
  verbose = deprecated()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Something that identifies the file of interest on your Google
Drive. Can be a name or path, a file id or URL marked with \code{\link[=as_id]{as_id()}}, or a
\code{\link{dribble}}.}

\item{path}{Specifies target destination for the file on Google
Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked with
\code{\link[=as_id]{as_id()}}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}.

If \code{path} is a shortcut to a folder, it is automatically resolved to its
target folder.

If \code{path} is given as a path (as opposed to a \code{dribble} or an id), it is
best to explicitly indicate if it's a folder by including a trailing
slash, since it cannot always be worked out from the context of the call.
By default, the file stays in its current folder.}

\item{name}{Character, new file name if not specified as part of
\code{path}. This will force \code{path} to be interpreted as a folder, even if it
is character and lacks a trailing slash. By default, the file keeps its current name.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical, indicating whether to check for a pre-existing file
at the targetted "filepath". The quotes around "filepath" refer to the fact
that Drive does not impose a 1-to-1 relationship between filepaths and files,
like a typical file system; read more about that in \code{\link[=drive_get]{drive_get()}}.
\itemize{
\item \code{NA} (default): Just do the operation, even if it results in multiple
files with the same filepath.
\item \code{TRUE}: Check for a pre-existing file at the filepath. If there is
zero or one, move a pre-existing file to the trash, then carry on. Note
that the new file does not inherit any properties from the old one, such
as sharing or publishing settings. It will have a new file ID. An error is
thrown if two or more pre-existing files are found. Use \code{drive_update()} or
\code{drive_put()} if you want to keep permissions and sharing from an already existing file.
\item \code{FALSE}: Error if there is any pre-existing file at the filepath.
}

Note that existence checks, based on filepath, are expensive operations, i.e.
they require additional API calls.}

\item{verbose}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} This logical argument to
individual googledrive functions is deprecated. To globally suppress
googledrive messaging, use \code{options(googledrive_quiet = TRUE)} (the default
behaviour is to emit informational messages). To suppress messaging in a
more limited way, use the helpers \code{\link[=local_drive_quiet]{local_drive_quiet()}} or
\code{\link[=with_drive_quiet]{with_drive_quiet()}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{dribble}}, a tibble with one row per file.

Move a Drive file to a different folder, give it a different name, or both.
